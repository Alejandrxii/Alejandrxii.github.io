### CPSC 120
* [Lab 3, Part-2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-03-alejandro-and-faith.git)

    In Lab 3, part 2, I most thoroughly enjoyed the use of the formula to convert Julian Days from a Gregorian Date. This expanded my mind about how complex and yet simple, a conversion of days can be. I also liked how we only used "int" types for the lab, as it made the coding experience very satisfying.
  
* [Lab 4, Part-1](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-faith-and-alejandro.git)

    Lab 4, more specifically part 1, had to be one of my favorite labs for a couple reasons. It introduced the duality and process of how two source files interact together. The lab also taught us how to code in the form of a specific algorithim. I really liked the whole metric system conversion too.

* [Lab 8, Part-1](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-alejandro-and-brennan.git)

    Part 1 of lab 8, was also a personal favorite because it required us to create a Mad Libs. This program made me feel like I was part of a software engineer team working on a software for food apps. We had to learn how to implement patterns into conversions of arguments and statements.
