### CPSC 120

* [Lab 4, Part-1](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-faith-and-alejandro.git)

    Lab 4 had to be one of my favorite labs for a couple reasons. It introduced the duality and process of how two source files interact together. The lab also taught us how to code in the form of a specific algorithim. I really liked the whole metric system conversion too.

* [Lab 8, Part-1](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-alejandro-and-brennan.git)

    Lab 8 was also a personal favorite because it required us to create a Mad Libs. This program made me feel like I was part of a software engineer team working on a software for food apps. We had to learn how to implement patterns into conversions of arguments and statements.
